## Fog Planning Algorithm Research and Design Carleton-SYSC
This repository is the first part of my fog facility planning research: the task allocation and facility planning policy design.
This project is developed in java, and implement two categories of algorithms (Conbinatorial Optimization algorithm and Heuristic algorithm).<br>
<br><b>Optimization algorithm:</b> FLP, K-MEANS, Weighted Sum, Lagrangian Dual and Meanshift.
<br><b>Heuristic algorithm:</b> PSO, NSGA, SPEA, MOCELL.

* The second part of this research, which is the fog network simulation, can be referred to [Fog-Simulation](https://github.com/qrafzv/fog-simulation)
